# QAMLC: Questions and Answers in Mathematics, Logical and Critical Thinking

## Overview

**QAMLC** is a **living, open-source dataset** designed to enhance mathematical reasoning, logical thinking, and critical analysis skills. It currently comprises **101 meticulously crafted questions**, each accompanied by **step-by-step solutions and verified answers**, primarily targeting learners up to the **Grade 6 level**. All content is presented in **English (UK)**.

## Key Features

- **Content Focus:**
  - Basic Arithmetic
  - Algebra
  - Patterns & Sequences
  - Logical Reasoning
  - Critical Thinking
  - Visual Reasoning (utilizing emojis)

- **Step-by-Step Solutions:** Each question is paired with a detailed solution, ensuring clarity and comprehensive understanding.

- **Emojis for Visual Engagement:** A distinctive aspect of QAMLC is the use of **emojis (ðŸŸ¦ðŸ”ºðŸ”µ)** to represent shapes (squares, triangles, circles, etc.), promoting visual reasoning. Examples include:
  - *Identify ðŸŸ¦ (square emoji) from a list of given emojis.*
  - *Count the ðŸ”µ (circle emojis) in the sequence.*
  
  Such questions are uncommon in other datasets.

- **Manual Verification:** Each entry has been manually authored and thoroughly checked for accuracy, authenticity, and grammatical correctness.

- **Python-Aided Generation:** A custom Python script assisted in framing certain questions, especially those involving grouping or counting emojis and introducing varied phrasing. Nonetheless, all solutions are written in natural human language and have undergone manual review.

- **Independent Creation:** The dataset was entirely developed by **Pulkit Sahu (VenusMoon)** without external funding or institutional backing.

## Motivation

While numerous datasets address mathematical and logical reasoning, **QAMLC** stands out due to its:

- **Step-by-step explanations** for every question.
- **Incorporation of visual reasoning** through emojis, a rare feature.
- **Originality**, with all questions manually created to ensure authenticity.
- **Accessibility**, serving as a free, open-source resource for learners, educators, researchers, and AI developers.

## Collection Process

To ensure the dataset's freshness and uniqueness, the questions and solutions were:

- **Self-created**, without direct replication from existing sources.
- Developed with the aid of a **Python program**, primarily to:
  - Randomly generate problem statements.
  - Group or count visual elements like emojis.
  - Introduce variety in phrasing.

**Reference Materials Consulted:**

- **CBSE Mathematics textbooks (India)**
- **US-based educational resources available online**

However, most questions and their step-by-step solutions are unique and unlikely to be found elsewhere.

**Data Pre-processing:** Post-creation, the dataset underwent:

- **Python-based pre-processing** to standardize formatting and structure.
- **Manual cleaning** to rectify any errors, ensuring the highest quality.

**Current Status:**

- **Size:** 101 Questions (with plans for expansion)
- **Review:** Solely reviewed by the creator; external reviews are pending.
- **Nature:** A living dataset, continually evolving.
