## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

Each data instance includes:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "question": "Identify the next number in this sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10",
  "type": "open-ended",
  "answer": "12",
  "solution": [
    "Given that:",
    "2, 4, 6, 8, 10",
    "We need to find out the next number in this sequence:",
    "2, 4, 6, 8, 10",
    "Letâ€™s find out some patterns between 1 and 3.",
    "Adding 2 to 2 gives 4",
    "2 + 2 = 4",
    "Now let's add 2 to 4",
    "2 + 4 = 6",
    "Similarly,",
    "2 + 6 = 8",
    "2 + 8 = 10",
    "The number in the given sequence is following a pattern: they are increasing by 2.",
    "So, add 2 to the last item in the sequence to get the next unknown number.",
    "2 + 10 = 12",
    "Thus, the next number in this sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is 12."
